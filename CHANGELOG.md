## [1.0.7] - 2025-07-28

### Fixed
- Implemented default broadcasters for GorillaPool mainnet and testnet.
- - Updated examples to use new broadcaster functions.

### Added
- Introduced `default_broadcaster` with configurable options for testnet and custom ARC configurations.
- Added function to set API key from constant.py for Taal mainnet and testnet (`taal_broadcaster`, `taal_testnet_broadcaster`).



## [1.0.6.1] - 2025-07-03

### Fixed
Bug Fix default_http_client and add async ARC broadcasting example 

- Replaced `default_sync_http_client` with `DefaultHttpClient` in `default_http_client`.
- Introduced a new `test_async_arc.py` example demonstrating asynchronous ARC broadcasting and transaction status checking.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-06-30

### Added
- Introduced `SyncHttpClient` for synchronous HTTP operations
- Extended ARC broadcaster with synchronous methods: `sync_broadcast`, `check_transaction_status`, and `categorize_transaction_status`
- Updated ARC configuration to include optional `SyncHttpClient` support
- Added examples, tests, and utilities for synchronous transactions

### Changed
- Updated `SyncHttpClient` to inherit from `HttpClient` for consistency
- Refactored `fetch` into higher-level HTTP methods: `get` and `post`
- Simplified ARC broadcaster by using `get` and `post` methods for sync operations
- Enhanced error handling and response processing in ARC transactions
- Updated tests and examples to align with refactored `SyncHttpClient`

---
## [1.0.5] - 2025-05-30

### Added
Introducing an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme for securely splitting and recovering private keys. 

The update includes the following:

- KeyShares, Polynomial, and PointInFiniteField classes to manage key splitting logic

- Integrity verification for share validation

- Robust error handling during reconstruction

- Comprehensive unit tests

- Examples demonstrating the use and behavior of the implemented methods

The implementation is designed to follow the functionality and interface of the existing TypeScript SDK. Compatibility has been verified.


---
## [1.0.4] - 2025-04-28

### Fixed
Remove debug print statement from MerklePath.trim() method and unnecessary import statement

### Added
add step-by-step guide for sending BSV & minting NFTs

Adds a beginner-friendly tutorial that covers:
* environment setup and dependency installation
* key / address generation
* sending BSV transactions
* creating & broadcasting 1Sat Ordinals NFTs
* explanation of inputs, outputs and key terms

### Changed
Enable regular hex format broadcasting when source transactions are unavailable
Enhance the ARC broadcaster to dynamically select between EF and regular hex formats based on the availability of source transactions. This update addresses scenarios such as receiving raw hex via P2P payment destination Paymail capabilities.
Additionally, unit tests have been added to cover this feature.


---
## [1.0.3] - 2025-03-26

### Fixed
Previously, the default fee rate was hardcoded to 10 satoshis per kilobyte. This update allows users to configure the default fee rate via the TRANSACTION_FEE_RATE variable in constants.py or through the environment file.

### Added
A test for the default fee rate has also been added.

### Changed
Optimized transaction preimage calculation by refactoring the tx_preimage function to directly compute the preimage for a specified input, avoiding unnecessary computation for all inputs
Achieved a 3Ã— performance improvement in scenarios with 250 inputs, based on benchmarking


## [1.0.2] - 2025-02-28

### Added
- BIP32_DERIVATION_PATH environment variable for customizing default derivation paths
- Dedicated BIP32 derivation functions with clearer interface
- BIP44-specific functions that build on the BIP32 foundation
- Comprehensive tests for HD wallet key derivation consistency
- Enhanced error messages for hardened key derivation attempts from xpub keys

### Fixed
- PUSHDATA opcode length parsing now uses unsigned integer reading methods (read_uint8, read_uint16_le, read_uint32_le) instead of signed integer methods to prevent incorrect chunk parsing with large data lengths
- Proper handling of edge cases in Script parsing including length 0 and incomplete length specifications
- Serialization/deserialization consistency for various PUSHDATA operations

### Changed
- Refined HD wallet key derivation interface while maintaining backward compatibility
- Improved error messages for invalid derivation attempts
- Marked legacy derivation functions as deprecated while maintaining compatibility


---
## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-09

### Added

 - Added support for Network enum initialization (Network.MAINNET/Network.TESTNET)
 - Added robust backward compatibility for string network parameters ('main'/'test'/'mainnet'/'testnet')
 - Added input validation and clear error messages for invalid network parameters
 - Added type hints and docstrings for better code clarity
- Added comprehensive test suite for WhatsOnChainBroadcaster:
 - Added test cases for Network enum initialization
 - Added test cases for string-based network parameters
 - Added validation tests for invalid network inputs
 - Added URL construction validation tests
